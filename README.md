## Continuous Deployment to Cloudflare Pages via Git

This project is configured for continuous deployment to Cloudflare Pages using Git. Every commit to the `main` branch will automatically trigger a new build and publish the changes to the Cloudflare network.

To get started with the continuous deployment process, simply make your changes on a local branch and push them to the main branch. Once the changes are merged into main, the continuous deployment process will automatically trigger a new build and publish the updated page to the Cloudflare network.
